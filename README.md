## Customization

### Adding New Exercises
Edit `data/exercises.json` and add new exercise objects with this format:

**For Strength:**
```json
{
  "id": 76,
  "name": "Exercise Name",
  "category": "Chest",
  "equipment": "Barbell",
  "type": "strength"
}
```

**For Cardio:**
```json
{
  "id": 77,
  "name": "Exercise Name",
  "category": "Cardio",
  "equipment": "Machine",
  "type": "cardio"
}
```

### Changing the Port
Edit `server.js` and change the `PORT` constant (default is 3001).

### Security
**Important**: Change the `JWT_SECRET` in `server.js` before deploying to production!

## Future Enhancements

Some ideas for extending this app:
- Add workout programs/routines
- Progress tracking and charts
- Personal records (PRs) tracking
- Social features (share workouts)
- Exercise instruction videos/images
- Rest timer between sets
- Calendar view of workouts
- Export workout data
- Upgrade to PostgreSQL or MongoDB for production

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**: Change the PORT variable in server.js

**Can't connect to server**: Make sure the server is running with `npm start`

**CORS errors**: The frontend makes requests to localhost:3001. If you change the port, update the API_URL in index.html

## License

Free to use and modify for personal or commercial projects.
